## SUMMARY

**Critical Missing Features (Must-Have for Launch):**
1. Multi-platform auto-posting
2. Analytics & monetization tracking dashboard

**High Priority (Should-Have Soon After Launch):**
3. Global monetization guides
4. App store deployment
5. Marketing & promotion strategy
6. Content scheduling & calendar

**Medium Priority (Nice-to-Have):**
7. AI education content expansion
8. Collaboration features

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Focus on #1 and #2 immediately. These were core promises in the original vision and are essential for the "$1M+ in 6 months" revenue goal. Without analytics, creators can't track their progress. Without multi-platform posting, they can't scale efficiently.
